# Ausadhi - Medicine Availability Tracker

"Know before you go. Find medicines near you in seconds."

Overview

Ausadhi is a hyper-local medicine availability tracker built specifically for Nepal. It connects pharmacy owners with the general public, allowing users to search for medicines and find nearby pharmacies that have them in stock.

Problem We Solve

- People waste hours visiting multiple pharmacies to find specific medicines
- No real-time visibility of medicine stock across pharmacies
- Patients with chronic conditions struggle to find their regular medications
- Pharmacy owners have no digital platform to showcase their inventory

Our Solution

- Real-time medicine search across verified pharmacies
- Pharmacy owners can easily manage their inventory
- Bulk upload via Excel for quick inventory setup
- Community-driven "Report Mismatch" system to maintain accuracy
- Anti-spam protection prevents competitors from sabotaging stock data

Key Features

Database Schema

User Model (Pharmacy Owner)

{
shopName: String, required, unique
ownerName: String, required
phone: String, required, unique
location: String, required
password: String, required, hashed
}

Medicine Model (Inventory)

{
pharmacyId: ObjectId, ref: 'User', required
medicineName: String, required, indexed
category: String
status: String, enum: ['Available', 'Out_of_Stock'], default: 'Available'
reportCount: Number, default: 0

Security Features

- JWT Authentication - Secure owner login
- Bcrypt Password Hashing - Passwords never stored in plain text
- Route Protection - Only owners can access dashboard
- Ownership Verification - Owners can only modify their own medicines
- Rate Limiting - Prevent API abuse (optional)

Anti-Spam Logic (Neighbor Sabotage Prevention)

1. Only owners can change medicine status
2. Public users can only report mismatches
3. Report threshold: If 5+ users report mismatch, owner gets alert
4. No automatic status change - Owner must manually verify and update
